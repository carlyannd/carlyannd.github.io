<h1>Role Call</h1>

<p>I always wonder about the path of individuals who have found success in creative fields.</p>
<p>After having lived in Chicago for a year or so, I realized how many successful creatives I was surrounded by, and whose acquaintance I had made. I thought, hey, I love writing stories about interesting people. I'm surrounded by them. And that's when I began asking the questions I so longed to know the answers to. And it turns out, all these great, successful people, were more than happy to share their stories with me</p>

<h2>Here are the stories of a writer, a photographer, and a musician.</h2>
